Wireframe magazine had a neat [lemmings](https://github.com/Wireframe-Magazine/Wireframe17/blob/master/lemmings.py) path-finding snippet implemented in pygame zero.

As it turns out, after typing the thing into my laptop during a dull wait for a delayed train, pygame doesn't display anything on my mac. It's a [problem with mojave macOS](https://github.com/pygame/pygame/issues/555), possibly to do with dark mode. Instead of lemmings, you just get a blank screen.

Because I already had `pyenv` installed and couldn't figure out how to make it use the installer version of Python 3.7.2, I searched for some other way around the issue.

The solution I found is to use `pyenv` to install `miniconda3-latest`, which plays nicely with mojave...

```
brew install pyenv
pyenv init - # put eval "$(pyenv init -)" in your ~/.bash_profile, too.
pyenv install miniconda3-latest
pyenv global miniconda3-latest
```

... and then install pgzero, Pillow and run the thing:

```
pip install pgzero
pip instasll Pillow
pgzrun script.py
```

Hooray! Lemmings!
